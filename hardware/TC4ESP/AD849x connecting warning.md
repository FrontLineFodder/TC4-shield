For anyone intending to approach this project, I want to warn about a connection trick between TC amplifier and ADC.

The short story is: they can't be connected directly soldering wires to existing pads, because the range will be limited to 150 C degrees.\
For the long story, detailed explanations, and the fix to this issue, please contact me directly, if you want to proceed before posting the full story here.
